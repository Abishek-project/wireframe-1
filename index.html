        <p class="para">A dramatically more powerful camera system. A display so responsive, every interaction feels new
            again. The
            world’s fastest smartphone chip. Exceptional durability. And a huge leap in battery life.
            Let’s Pro.The iPhone 13 and 13 Mini feature the same camera system with three cameras: one front-facing
            camera
            (12MP f/2.2) and two back-facing cameras: a wide (12MP f/1.6) and ultra-wide (12MP f/2.4) camera. The
            back-facing cameras both contain larger sensors for more light-gathering with new sensor shift optical image
            stabilization (OIS) on main camera. The camera module on the back is arranged diagonally instead of
            vertically
            to engineer the larger sensors.[citation needed]

            The cameras use Apple's latest computational photography engine, called Smart HDR 4. Users can also choose
            from
            a range of photographic styles during capture, including rich contrast, vibrant, warm, and cool. Apple
            clarifies
            this is different from a filter, because it works intelligently with the image processing algorithm during
            capture to apply local adjustments to an image and the effects will be baked into the photos unlike filters
            which can be removed after applying.[citation needed]

                <h1>About us</h1>
                <p class="ip">The iPhone is a series of smartphones made by Apple Inc since 2007. It does many things
                    that a
                    computer can do, but is small enough to fit in someone's hand.All iPhones run on a mobile operating
                    system which Apple calls "iOS". A new version of iOS comes out every year, each having more features
                    than the one before. Each new iPhone comes with the latest version of iOS, and older iPhones usually
                    also get a software update to the latest version. The more-recent iPhones, such as the iPhone 13 and
                    variants of it, use iOS 15 and came out in September 2021.</p>

                    <P class="ip">The original iPhone has been described as "revolutionary", a "game-changer" for the
                        mobile phone
                        industry, and has been credited with helping to make Apple one of the world's most valuable
                        publicly traded companies by 2011.The iPhone doesn't have as many buttons as other well-known
                        phones in the early days, such as those made by companies like Motorola and Nokia. Instead, it
                        had a touch screen that covers much of the front of the phone. People control the phone by
                        touching things that appear on the screen with a finger or two.</P>
